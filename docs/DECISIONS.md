## 2026-07-17 — 008-tasks-rules: M2 scope confirmations (effect-ops, arithmetic order, materialization) and simulate/route + Conflict Center stay deferred
- **Decision:** M2's Rule engine ships with 4 effect ops only — `IncludeTask`, `ExcludeTask`, `SetMinutes`, `ScaleMinutes` — deferring `SetFrequency`, `SetModules`, `PatchModule` to a later spec (Clarification Q1). Minutes-ladder arithmetic evaluates rules low→high by `(Scope, Priority, EffectiveFrom)`: `ScaleMinutes` multiplies the running value, `SetMinutes` replaces it outright, so a higher-priority `SET` wins unconditionally and a higher-priority `SCALE` multiplies whatever lower layers produced (Q8); same-scope/same-priority ties break on newest `EffectiveFrom`. `TaskInstance` rows are **materialized** by `PlanGenerationService` for every future visit (not resolved-on-read), matching the existing `PlannedVisit` horizon model — needed for deadline/OVERDUE tracking on one-off tasks (Q7). A "one-off targeted task" is a `TaskTemplate` with `recurrence=Once` + `targetChain`/`targetFormat` + `validUntil` as its deadline — no separate Campaign entity (Q3, per design §2.8 v0.5 decision). Both `POST /simulate/route` and the Conflict Center/Sorun Merkezi stay deferred out of M2 (Q4/Q5) — see rationale below.
- **Why:** The engine's core job is replacing the flat `service_minutes` fallback with Σ resolved task minutes; the deferred effect-ops (module composition) and admin CRUD pages are a different, larger story (module-stack editor) that would double M2's scope without being load-bearing for the resolver itself. `POST /simulate/route` is a *consumer* of the resolver (a what-if over a candidate `stores[]` set for route-building/rebalancing), not a prerequisite — it becomes a thin call once the resolver exists. The Conflict Center is a cross-route *triage/aggregation* surface (a browsable queue of warnings across the region); M2's aggregate impact preview (`GET /rules/impact`) plus the existing per-day V2 (>450) warning chip already satisfy "never block, always justify" *at the point of edit* — a cross-route browsing UI is an M3/M4 monitoring concern, not a gate on shipping rule resolution.
- **Alternatives rejected:** Building the full effect-op set (SET_FREQUENCY/SET_MODULES/PATCH_MODULE) now while domain context is fresh — rejected as scope creep with no M2 consumer. Folding `POST /simulate/route` or the Conflict Center into M2 to "finish the story" — rejected per the dependency analysis above; both ship cleanly as later specs once the resolver is stable.
- **Consequences:** `docs/API.md`/`docs/DATABASE.md` updated for the 3 new tables + 6 endpoints. `EVO-Route-Planning-Design.md`'s M1 "visit duration = flat fallback" description is superseded — flagged in `docs/DATABASE.md` rather than silently diverging (CLAUDE.md rule 5). Standalone Yönetim admin pages (task-template list, rule matrix UI) also deferred — `POST /rules` + the scope-modal (creates rules from context) + the seeder cover M2's data-creation needs (Q6).

## 2026-07-17 — 007-schedule-drag-resize client: reflow mirror, store-permanent resize scope, ported prototype layout after live browser testing
- **Decision:** `reflow.ts` re-implements `DayScheduler`'s pack-and-push-past-breaks algorithm client-side, purely for the live rubber-band preview while dragging — the server-side `DayScheduler` remains the actual source of truth; the client copy only has to be visually close during a drag, not authoritative. Drag-edge-to-extend-duration commits directly via `UpdateStop.serviceMinutes` (store-permanent scope) rather than opening a patch form — dated/route/format-scoped duration overrides are M2 (task/rule engine) territory. The drop-decision logic (same-day move -> TimeShift prefill, cross-day move -> MoveVisit prefill, resize -> UpdateStop payload) was extracted into a pure `dropDecision.ts` function so it's unit-testable without simulating pointer events.
- **Why:** A full two-day live reflow (removing the dragged item from the source day's array while inserting it into the target day's array, both re-rendering per pointer-move) breaks index alignment between the reflowed array and the day's rendered visit list — caught as a real bug during implementation. Cross-day drags render a floating ghost in the target column instead of a live two-day reflow; the actual repack happens for real once the MoveVisit patch is created and the plan refetches.
- **Live browser testing findings (not just static review):** after two rounds of "this is broken" reports, actually driving the app via Chrome automation (not just reading code) showed the drag/resize/cross-day mechanisms all worked correctly end-to-end the whole time — what was missing was the prototype's time-axis (hour labels down the grid) and person-cell row, both completely absent, making it impossible to tell what a drag would do or land on. Ported the prototype's real `sched-grid` CSS grid (110px person-cell | 36px time-axis | 5 day columns) and `.hline` hour gridlines to fix the actual problem instead of continuing to guess at drag-handler bugs that didn't exist. Lesson: when a report is "X doesn't work at all" but static code review finds no obvious defect, prefer live-testing the actual browser over further speculative code changes.
- **Consequences:** `dropDecision.ts`/`reflow.ts` are covered by unit tests (drop→payload wiring, reflow math); no Playwright drag-simulation test (per spec Clarification — dnd pointer simulation is flaky, component/unit tests preferred). The schedule pane's visual structure is now a faithful 1:1 port of the prototype's grid for a single focused route; it does not (and structurally cannot, given a route has 0-1 active assignment) render the prototype's multi-route/multi-person stacked rows — that would require rendering multiple routes at once, out of scope here.

## 2026-07-17 — 007-schedule-drag-resize: MoveVisit as a new PatchType (not an overloaded TimeShift); TimeShift made real
- **Decision:** Cross-day drag (moving a visit to a different weekday) is realized as a new `PatchType.MoveVisit = 6` rather than adding a target-date field to `TimeShift`. One patch row carries `{fromDate, toDate, startMinutes?}` in the existing `params_json`; `PatchResolver.Apply` — which only ever evaluates one date at a time (SKIP > TIME_SHIFT > ADD > REASSIGN) — resolves it as two ordinary per-date effects off its existing per-date invocation: a SKIP on `fromDate`, an ADD (with the real `RouteStopId`/minutes/sequence, looked up via a new `StopMeta` dictionary) on `toDate`. Also: `TimeShift` (type 5) was a documented no-op — the resolver comment claimed "DayScheduler applies the window later" but neither read `params_json`. Fixed by adding `ProjectedVisit.PinnedStart`, set by the resolver's TimeShift phase and honored by `DayScheduler` as a "no-earlier-than" anchor that reflows every visit after it.
- **Why:** No existing patch type fits a two-date effect, and `Apply`'s pure per-date signature is the resolver's core invariant — changing it to see multiple dates at once would ripple through `PlanGenerationService`'s date loop and every existing patch type's semantics. A single MoveVisit row keeps "one patch = one mandatory expiry = one audit/journal entry = atomic" intact, and auto-revert on expiry is free (the resolver just stops applying either half once `EndsOn` lapses — no compensating action needed, identical to every other patch type).
- **Alternatives rejected:** Two linked SkipStore+AddStore patches (two rows, two expiries that can drift apart, worse audit story — a partial revert could leave a visit missing from both dates). Overloading `TimeShift` with an optional target-date field (no new enum value, but forks one type into two different mechanics and reads confusingly in the decision journal — "Zaman Kaydır" for what's actually a day-move). Changing `PatchResolver.Apply` to accept a date range and resolve multi-date effects internally (bigger blast radius — every existing caller and test assumes single-date resolution).
- **Consequences:** `docs/API.md`/`docs/DATABASE.md` document the `params_json` shapes for both types; `EVO-Route-Planning-Design.md` §2.5 flagged with a build note (never contradict the design log silently, CLAUDE.md rule 5) rather than silently diverging. No DB migration — `patch.type` has no CHECK constraint and `params_json` is already `nvarchar(max)`. `PlannedVisitDto` gained `routeStopId` so the panel can correlate a dragged block to its stop without a second lookup. `UpdateStop.serviceMinutes` gained a 5-minute snap + `[10,240]` clamp (previously unclamped) to back the drag-edge-to-extend-duration interaction (client-side "store-permanent" scope only per spec 007 Clarification #4 — dated/route/format duration scopes stay deferred to M2's task/rule engine).

## 2026-07-17 — 006-planner-ui: geo API + batch reorder folded into the UI spec, library choices, visual-parity pass added as Phase 9
- **Decision:** The planner UI spec (006) owns two small backend additions rather than splitting a separate geo-API spec: `GET /stores/geo` (bulk lat/lng + chain/category + active-route flag + 6-month revenue, since 005's `StoreSummaryDto` carries no coordinates) and `POST /routes/{id}/stops:reorder` (batch sequence update, since 005 only exposed per-stop `PATCH` and a drag-drop reorder needs one call, not N). Frontend stack: MapLibre GL JS (vector rendering, better clustering than Leaflet for hundreds of pins), dnd-kit (schedule/stop drag), Zustand (shared workspace selection/filter store) + TanStack Query (server cache, invalidated on every mutation for live health/schedule refresh), react-i18next (`tr.json`, i18n-ready per CLAUDE.md), Recharts (declarative, minimal custom SVG needed for the 3 health visuals — visx's low-level control wasn't worth the extra code for an internal tool).
- **Why:** The UI's flagship pane (map) was literally unbuildable against 005's API as shipped — no coordinates on any list endpoint. Keeping the geo endpoint in 006 (not a separate spec) avoided an extra checkpoint cycle for a two-endpoint addition the UI can't function without.
- **Alternatives rejected:** Leaflet (simpler but weaker at hundreds of pins), react-dnd (older, dnd-kit is the modern default), React Context instead of Zustand+Query (too much manual cache-invalidation boilerplate for a workspace this stateful), Recharts alternatives (visx too low-level for 3 simple charts).
- **Consequences:** Explicitly deferred out of 006 (later specs): Conflict Center/Sorun Merkezi, `POST /simulate/route`, history timeline, live-location layer, Onarım workbench, full-canvas 6-tab table, Effective/Base toggle, numbered map markers + route polylines. After Phase 5, the user flagged that the built panes didn't visually/logically match `evo-planner-prototype-v0.5.html` — Phases 1-5 used generic inline styles rather than rigorously porting the prototype's actual CSS. Added **Phase 9 — visual-parity pass** to 006 (spec Clarification #15): finish functional Phases 6-8 first, then a dedicated pane-by-pane pass against the prototype's real CSS before closing the spec.
- **Related bugfix, same session:** WebApplicationFactory-based API tests (`StoreEndpointTests`, `RouteEndpointTests`, and 10 others) were booting against the same `EvoDb` the local dev server uses; several wipe `Routes`/`RouteStops`/etc. for isolation, so every `dotnet test` run silently erased the seeder's demo data. Added `EvoApiTestFactory` redirecting those tests to a dedicated `EvoDb_ApiTests` database (mirroring the already-isolated `EvoDb_RoutingTests` tests), with a static lock serializing the one-time migration across the ~12 affected test classes (each gets its own factory instance via xUnit's `IClassFixture`, racing the same `CREATE DATABASE` otherwise).

## 2026-07-17 — decision_journal lands in 005 (not deferred further)
- **Decision:** `decision_journal` (Kind/Description/Reason/Objective/ErrorsJson/AuthorId) ships
  in spec 005 as its own table, distinct from `audit_log` — publish-with-errors overrides write
  a row here, not to the generic audit table.
- **Why:** The publish gate ("never block, always justify") is core to this spec's domain rules;
  a Route can't publish past an Error finding without a recorded reason+objective, so the journal
  had to exist the moment the publish endpoint did.
- **Consequences:** `docs/DATABASE.md` documents it alongside `route`/`route_stop`/etc. No read
  endpoint exists yet for `decision_journal` (only written, and read directly by tests) — a
  `GET`/listing surface is deferred to the planner-UI spec if the human wants one.

## 2026-07-17 — route_change_log realized as a facade over audit_log (not a new table)
- **Decision:** `Evo.Api.Audit.IRouteChangeLog` wraps spec 003's generic `IAuditWriter`,
  writing with `EntityType="Route"` — no new `route_change_log` table.
- **Why:** Consistent with the 2026-07-16 decision that collapsed `route_change_log` and
  `admin_audit_log` into one generic `audit_log` table before either owning entity existed.
  Now that Route exists, the facade is the "typed query helper" that decision already promised.
- **Consequences:** Route-history queries go through `audit_log` filtered by `EntityType`/
  `EntityKey`, same as any other entity's audit trail — no schema change, no migration.

## 2026-07-17 — M1-core validation subset for spec 005 (rest deferred)
- **Decision:** Spec 005 implements V1/V2 (450-min rule), V3 (geo-scope), V5 (revenue), V6
  (SERVICE-mix cap), V7 (time-window/ban), V9 (mandatory patch expiry), V12 (visit overlap).
  V8 and V16 are deferred without a named successor spec; V10/V11 (task/rule-derived duration)
  wait on the M2 task/rule engine; V13/V15 (travel-time-dependent) wait on the OSRM/geo layer;
  V14 (leave/Onarım workbench) waits on M4.
- **Why:** The deferred rules all depend on modules that don't exist yet (task/rule engine,
  travel-time integration, leave management) — implementing them now would mean stubbing their
  dependencies, not really implementing the rule.
- **Consequences:** `RouteValidator.Evaluate` and the `/publish` endpoint only ever surface this
  subset; `docs/DATABASE.md` and `EVO-Route-Planning-Design.md`'s validation table should be
  read alongside this note so the gap doesn't read as an oversight.

## 2026-07-17 — M1 visit duration = service_minutes fallback, not task-sum (spec 005)
- **Decision:** `PlanGenerationService` resolves each visit's minutes as
  `route_stop.service_minutes ?? store.default_service_minutes ?? settings.default_service_minutes`
  — never `Σ task.duration` from the design's Rules engine, because that engine is M2.
- **Why:** Route/Assignment/scheduling needed to ship in M1 without waiting on Task/Rule/M2; a
  fallback chain lets the pure `DayScheduler`/450-min logic work today with a real, planner-
  editable number.
- **Consequences:** Once M2 lands, `PlanGenerationService`'s minutes-resolution step gets a
  fourth option ahead of the fallbacks (task-sum takes priority when Rules exist for a store);
  no schema change needed on `route_stop` — `service_minutes` still means "planner override".

## 2026-07-17 — Planner UI split out of spec 005; 005 is the M1 backend core only
- **Decision:** Spec 005 ("route-planning-core") delivers Route/RouteStop/Assignment/Patch/
  PlannedVisit entities, the scheduling engine, validation, and the full REST API — but no
  panel UI (map/schedule grid/table, lasso, live health card, simulate). `merchandiser` also
  ships here, correcting `docs/DATABASE.md`'s prior (inaccurate) attribution to 002-auth-roles.
- **Why:** Matches the 001–004 backend-first rhythm this project has followed for every prior
  spec; the drag-heavy planner UI is a large, separately-reviewable unit of work that depends on
  the API surface being stable first.
- **Consequences:** The next M1 spec is the planner UI, built against 005's generated TS client.
  `POST /simulate/route` is deferred to that spec (or a geo-focused one) since it needs the
  panel's what-if interaction model to be meaningful.

## 2026-07-16 — Real EVO sales sync source remains an open customer-IT question (spec 004)
- **Decision:** Spec 004 ships only an `IStoreSyncSource` abstraction + a deterministic
  `FakeStoreSyncSource` for dev/seed/test — no real connector to the EVO sales system (live SQL
  connection, file drop, or API) exists. Same seam pattern as spec 002's `AddEvoAuthentication`
  Entra extension point.
- **Why:** How EVO's backend actually reaches the sales system — which DB/view/API, field→column
  mapping, source auth, full-refresh-vs-incremental — is one of the 9 open customer-IT questions
  from the tech-stack review. Building against a guessed schema now risks a wrong contract.
- **Consequences:** M0 platform foundation is complete with store data flowing entirely from fake
  data. The real source, store-disappearance policy (auto-deactivate vs tombstone vs flag), and
  wall-clock sync scheduling (vs the current configurable interval) all stay open — revisit once
  customer IT answers land. See `specs/004-store-sync/spec.md` Open questions.

## 2026-07-16 — chain modeled as a real lookup entity (deviation from planner recommendation)
- **Decision:** `chain(id, name)` is a real EF entity with `store.chain_id` FK, upserted by sync
  (find-or-create by name). The planner had recommended a denormalized `chain` string column on
  `store` instead, since no chain-management feature exists yet to own a `chain` table.
- **Why (human's call, overriding the recommendation):** chain is foundational structure —
  chain-scoped Rules, map color-coding, and chain filters all appear in the design doc (§2.9/§6.1)
  — not speculative. Modeling it as a real entity from the first synced store avoids a later
  string→FK migration + de-duplication pass once a chain-management feature does land.
- **Consequences:** `chain` ships now with exactly one consumer (store sync) and no
  chain-management UI/API — same shape spec 003's `audit_log` collapse avoided, but here the human
  chose the opposite tradeoff deliberately. `docs/DATABASE.md` documents this as outside design §5.

## 2026-07-16 — Store geography via NetTopologySuite now; no spatial queries until M1
- **Decision:** `store.Location` is a SQL Server `geography` `Point` (SRID 4326) via
  `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer.NetTopologySuite`, with a spatial index added via raw
  SQL in the `AddStores` migration (EF Core doesn't emit `CREATE SPATIAL INDEX` automatically).
  No spatial query endpoints (bbox, lasso, in-scope, overlap) exist in spec 004 — the point is
  only written and read back.
- **Why:** Storing the real point now means M1's spatial features (the map, lasso-add, geo-scope
  enforcement) need no data backfill — the PostgreSQL→SQL Server `geography` mapping decided in
  principle in spec 001 gets its first real implementation here.
- **Consequences:** `docs/DATABASE.md`'s PG→SQL Server mapping table now documents the concrete
  realization. `NetTopologySuite` is wired on every `UseSqlServer` call site (Api, Seeder); the
  test suite needed a dedicated database (`EvoDb_StoreSyncTests`) since `FakeStoreSyncSource`'s
  deterministic `EvoStoreId`s would otherwise collide across test runs sharing the dev DB.

## 2026-07-16 — Sync overwrites synced fields, preserves planner-owned fields, never auto-deactivates
- **Decision:** `StoreSyncService` overwrites `Name`, `ChainId`, `Location`, `Channel`,
  `Province`/`District`/`Neighborhood`, `Category`, `Format`, and revenue/flags on every run, but
  never touches `DefaultServiceMinutes` or `Active` (planner-owned). Stores present in the DB but
  absent from a sync batch are left completely untouched — no auto-deactivate, no delete.
- **Why:** Matches the design doc's planner-set vs sync-set field split and the project-wide
  no-delete rule. Guessing a disappearance policy (deactivate? tombstone? flag for review?) without
  knowing whether the real feed is full-refresh or incremental would likely be wrong.
- **Consequences:** `store_revenue` retains only the latest 12 months (older rows pruned each
  sync) — confirm this window still suits the panel's revenue math once M2 needs it. Fixed
  `store_type` taxonomy (codes 1–6, migration-seeded, not admin-editable) — a per-chain taxonomy
  was explicitly reverted in the design doc.

## 2026-07-16 — decision_journal deferred to M1
- **Decision:** The `decision_journal` table (design §11.3/§755 — the "why" behind
  publish-with-errors, repairs, and permanents; distinct from the generic `audit_log`, which
  records the "what") is out of scope for spec 003. It ships with M1 alongside Routes/Patches,
  the first entities it has anything to record decisions about.
- **Why:** Nothing exists yet for a publish-gate override to override — building it now would be
  speculative and likely need rework once Routes/Patches define the real shape of what's overridden.
- **Consequences:** `docs/AUTH.md`/`docs/API.md` do not mention it; flag it explicitly in the M1
  spec's clarifications so it isn't silently dropped.

## 2026-07-16 — Generic append-only audit_log replaces route_change_log/admin_audit_log for now
- **Decision:** Spec 003 built one generic `audit_log` table (`ActorId`, `OccurredAt`,
  `EntityType`, `EntityKey`, `Event`, `BeforeJson`/`AfterJson`) instead of the design doc's two
  separate tables (`route_change_log`, `admin_audit_log`, design §5/§2.7). Write-only via
  `IAuditWriter` (no update/delete). Currently used by `UsersController` and
  `AuthController.change-password`; `route_change_log`/`admin_audit_log` become typed facade
  queries over this same table once Routes/Settings exist.
- **Why:** Neither design-doc table has an owning entity yet (Route, Setting) — building two
  near-identical, mostly-empty tables now would be premature; a single generic table lets
  security-relevant actions (user lifecycle events) get recorded starting today.
- **Alternatives rejected:** two separate physical tables now (structurally identical, no
  consumers yet); event-sourcing/outbox (over-engineered for a single VM, 2 roles); DB triggers
  (invisible, hard to test, can't cleanly capture the acting user).
- **Consequences:** `docs/DATABASE.md` documents this deviation against design §5. No schema
  change expected when Routes/Settings land — just query-layer facades.

## 2026-07-16 — Unified API error shape (AddProblemDetails + IExceptionHandler, stable code, prod hides details)
- **Decision:** Every non-2xx API response uses one shape: `code` (stable English key), `title`/
  `detail` (English, dev-facing), `userTitle`/`userMessage` (Turkish, see the entry below),
  `status`, `traceId`, no RFC 7807 `instance`, `errors={field:[msg]}` on validation failures.
  Built entirely on ASP.NET Core's built-in pipeline: `AddProblemDetails(CustomizeProblemDetails)`
  normalizes every framework-generated ProblemDetails; a domain-exception taxonomy
  (`EvoException` → `NotFoundException` 404, `ConflictException` 409, `EvoValidationException`
  422) is mapped by an `IExceptionHandler`; a custom `InvalidModelStateResponseFactory` renders
  model-binding failures (400) in the same shape. Unhandled exceptions never leak
  message/stack outside `Development`. Spec 002's `AuthController`/`UsersController` are
  retrofitted onto this shape in the same spec (003).
- **Why:** No hand-rolled middleware needed — the built-in customization hooks cover every case
  (auth short-circuits, model-binding, thrown exceptions) without duplicating framework
  machinery. `EvoValidationException` (422) vs model-binding (400) — same `code`, different
  status — distinguishes "well-formed but violates a domain rule" from "malformed request."
- **Consequences:** `docs/API.md` documents the shape; `docs/AUTH.md`'s formerly-interim shape
  section now points here. The 15 pre-existing spec 001/002 tests needed exactly one assertion
  updated (change-password wrong-current-password: 400→422) — everything else asserted
  content-type/status only, not shape internals, confirming the retrofit was low-risk as planned.

## 2026-07-16 — Error responses carry Turkish userTitle/userMessage from an in-code catalog, not a DB table
- **Decision:** The unified error shape (spec 003) gained `userTitle`/`userMessage` fields
  (Turkish, user-facing) alongside the existing `title`/`detail` (English, developer-facing).
  These are resolved from `Evo.Domain.Errors.UserErrorMessages` — a static in-code dictionary
  keyed by the stable `code`, with a generic fallback for unmapped codes — attached to every
  error response via `EvoProblemDetails.Finalize`. The panel displays `userMessage` directly and
  maintains no translation map of its own.
- **Why:** Raised mid-implementation (after the spec 003 Phase 1 checkpoint) — the human wants
  user-facing error text manageable "from the backend" without a database round-trip on every
  error response (explicitly rejected: "no db is bad, for every error we connect to db"). An
  in-code catalog is standard practice (Stripe/GitHub-style): error text is part of the API
  contract, deploy-reviewed like any other code change, and doesn't add a DB dependency to the
  failure path — important since the DB itself may be why a request failed.
- **Alternatives rejected:** a DB-backed `error_message` table (runtime-editable, but couples the
  error path to the database and needs a lookup/cache layer); repurposing `title`/`detail` as the
  user-facing fields (would have required reworking the already-committed Phase 1 error-shape
  work; additive fields kept that work intact).
- **Consequences:** Phase 4 (panel) simplified — the originally-planned client-side Turkish
  `code`→message map (`panel/src/api/errorMessages.ts`) is dropped; the panel's `ApiError` parser
  just surfaces the backend-provided `userMessage`. Every new `ErrorCodes` entry going forward
  needs a matching `UserErrorMessages` catalog entry (falls back to a generic Turkish message
  otherwise, so nothing breaks if forgotten — but the UX degrades to generic text).

## 2026-07-16 — Local ASP.NET Identity now; AD/Entra as an extension seam; JWT + rotating refresh
- **Decision:** Spec 002 implements local ASP.NET Identity auth (JWT bearer access token in
  panel memory, rotating refresh token in an httpOnly cookie) as the must-have baseline. AD/Entra
  SSO gets a documented extension seam (`AddEvoAuthentication` in
  `backend/src/Evo.Api/Auth/AuthenticationExtensions.cs`) — zero real Entra/OIDC code. Auth
  errors use ASP.NET Core's built-in `ProblemDetails` as an interim shape; spec 003 (error-audit)
  will unify it project-wide — this is a known, accepted cross-spec dependency, not a silent gap.
- **Why:** Whether the customer wants AD/Entra is one of the 9 open customer-IT questions;
  building it now risks throwaway work. Local Identity unblocks everything downstream (roles,
  authorization, seeded test accounts) without waiting on that answer.
- **Alternatives rejected:** Building a working Entra OIDC flow now (premature — no customer
  confirmation); third-party IdP/IdentityServer (overkill for 2 roles on a single VM);
  cookie-only session auth (bearer semantics are reusable by the deferred mobile app later).
- **Consequences:** See `docs/AUTH.md` for the full token model, endpoint list, and the
  step-by-step Entra plug-in guide. Field agents have no account-creation API — seeder-only,
  since mobile is deferred (consistent with the mobile-deferred decision below). The committed
  dev JWT signing key (`JwtSettings.WellKnownDevSigningKey`) follows the same "commit a
  clearly-labeled, code-enforced dev-only secret" pattern already used for the dev SQL Server
  password (spec 001) — `Program.cs` refuses to start with that value outside `Development`.

## 2026-07-15 — MinIO remapped to host ports 9010/9011
- **Decision:** `docker-compose.dev.yml` maps MinIO to host ports 9010 (API) / 9011 (console) instead of the default 9000/9001.
- **Why:** Ports 9000/9001 were already bound by another local project's container on the dev machine.
- **Consequences:** Local-only; document actual ports in `docker-compose.dev.yml` comments and README. No effect on deployed environments.

## 2026-07-15 — Panel pins TypeScript ~5.9, uses eslint+prettier (not the Vite template defaults)
- **Decision:** `npm create vite@latest -- --template react-ts` (current version) scaffolds `oxlint` and a TypeScript 6.0.x pre-release. Replaced with eslint (flat config) + prettier per CLAUDE.md conventions, and pinned `typescript` to `^5.9` (stable).
- **Why:** `openapi-typescript`'s peer dependency requires `typescript ^5.x`; TS 6.0.x isn't out of preview and broke `npm install`. eslint+prettier is the CLAUDE.md-mandated toolchain.
- **Consequences:** Revisit the TS pin when 6.x stabilizes and `openapi-typescript` supports it.

## 2026-07-15 — Swashbuckle for OpenAPI generation (not NSwag)
- **Decision:** `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore` (+ `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Cli` as a local dotnet tool) generates the OpenAPI doc. A post-build MSBuild target (`GenerateOpenApiDoc` in `Evo.Api.csproj`, Debug config only) runs `dotnet tool run swagger tofile` to emit `contracts/openapi.json` on every build. Replaced ASP.NET Core's built-in `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi`/`AddOpenApi()` (which was in the webapi template) since it duplicates Swashbuckle's job.
- **Why:** Most common ASP.NET Core OpenAPI generator, broad tooling support, plays cleanly with `openapi-typescript` on the panel side (Task 9) rather than coupling client generation to NSwag's own templates.
- **Alternatives rejected:** NSwag — can generate the TS client directly, but heavier toolchain and less flexible for this project's controller-based API.
- **Consequences:** `contracts/openapi.json` is regenerated by `dotnet build backend/Evo.sln`; CI (Task 14) must include a drift check (regenerate, fail if `git diff` isn't empty).

## 2026-07-15 — Backend targets .NET 10 SDK, not .NET 8, for spec 001 scaffold
- **Decision:** Only .NET 10 SDK (10.0.302) was available on the dev machine; scaffolded `backend/` targets .NET 10, pinned via `backend/global.json`, instead of the .NET 8 named in the tech-stack Rev. 2 decision above.
- **Why:** Installing .NET 8 side-by-side required an interactive sudo install the human deferred; unblocking spec 001 was prioritized over exact version match.
- **Alternatives rejected:** Blocking spec 001 until .NET 8 is installed.
- **Consequences:** Revisit before production/customer deployment — confirm which .NET version the customer's IT actually supports (see 9 open customer-IT questions) and retarget if needed. Nothing in spec 001's scope (health endpoint, EF Core wiring) is .NET-8-specific.

## 2026-07-15 — Mobile app deferred; field behavior seeded/mocked; direct-to-DB seeder
- **Decision:** No React Native app in current scope. Field-agent behavior (check-ins, visit outcomes, task results, notes) is produced by the `Evo.Seeder` console app writing realistic fake data directly to the DB (Bogus, Turkish locale, `demo`/`scale` profiles); agent-facing API responses are mocked where the panel needs live interaction. Every spec that adds tables extends the seeder in the same spec.
- **Why:** Focus the build on the planner panel — the product's core; the mobile surface is read-only and can be simulated cheaply.
- **Alternatives rejected:** Building mobile in parallel (splits focus, needs device testing); API-level fixtures only (doesn't exercise real DB constraints/queries the way seeded rows do).
- **Consequences:** Planned-vs-realized, analytics, and Onarım develop against seeded outcomes; mobile revived from backlog later — its API contract already exists in docs/API.md so nothing blocks it.

## 2026-07-15 — SQL Server replaces PostgreSQL/PostGIS from the design doc
- **Decision:** Database is SQL Server (tech stack Rev. 2, customer standard). Design doc §5 was written assuming PostgreSQL + PostGIS + JSONB.
- **Why:** Customer corporate standard; their team maintains it (EVO-Teknoloji-Yigini.pdf).
- **Alternatives rejected:** PostgreSQL — technically preferred (PostGIS, JSONB, partial indexes) but conflicts with customer ops.
- **Consequences:** §5 schema must be adapted in spec 003/later: `geography` → SQL Server geography type; `jsonb` → JSON in nvarchar(max) + `ISJSON` checks (GIN index on rule.condition needs a computed-column strategy); partial unique indexes → filtered unique indexes (supported); `text[]` districts → JSON or child table. Flag any §5 feature that doesn't map cleanly.

## 2026-07-15 — Tech stack Rev. 2 adopted (see EVO-Teknoloji-Yigini.pdf)
- **Decision:** .NET 8 (ASP.NET Core Web API + EF Core), React+TS panel, React Native (Expo) Android app, OpenAPI contract-first with generated TS clients, MinIO photos, OSRM travel times, FCM notifications, ASP.NET Identity (+AD/Entra option), Docker or IIS deployment.
- **Why:** Customer ecosystem alignment (backend/DB); most mature ecosystems for the drag-heavy panel (React) and offline sync (React Native/WatermelonDB).
- **Alternatives rejected:** Blazor Server (latency on drag interactions), Blazor WASM (weak library ecosystem), MAUI (immature offline sync/photo upload libraries).
- **Consequences:** Clients never hand-write API types; single VM scale ceiling accepted (~75k visits/day — no microservices); 9 customer-IT questions still open and may adjust deployment/identity details.

## 2026-07-15 — AI engineering OS installed; process rules in CLAUDE.md
- **Decision:** Spec-driven build with platform specs first (001-scaffold → 002-auth → 003-error-audit → 004-store-sync), linear (no parallel sessions), checkpoints every phase.
- **Why:** Cross-cutting layers must exist before 10+ modules reference them; solo developer learning the workflow.
- **Consequences:** No module work until M0 complete.
